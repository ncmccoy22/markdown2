Check out Content Rules to learn more about where Valerie contributes her expert knowledge, or browse their resources for more information about content strategy. Overview This presentation from Valerie Swisher provided an easy way to understand the concept of standardization and personalization. Valerie\u2019s definition of personalization is: \u201cdelivering the right content, to the right person, at the right time, on the right device, in the right language. It\u2019s delivering what someone needs, where they are, when they need it, nothing more, nothing less.\u201d Valerie then discussed the paradox regarding personalization and standardization, and elaborated on how it\u2019s actually possible to bridge the gap. She mentioned that \u201cyou can\u2019t create independent content for every single person,\u201d but if users have choices you allow them to have a more personalized experience. As a user \u201cyou personalize your experience because you have selected from a small set of standardized small components.\u201d The Personalization Paradox: To personalize, you must standardize You can\u2019t create independent content for every single person You need a balance between standardization and personalization Consider a housing analogy. Apartment units are typically standardized, vs. custom built homes. Consider further, a planned community development. In a planned community homes are customized within a set of parameters. You can choose specifics from a limited set. \u201cYou personalize your experience because you have selected from a small set of standardized small components\u201d Each component can be mixed and matched. Each component is scalable to personalize. Key takeaways As technical communicators the Personalization Paradox enforces the notion that we always need to keep our audience in mind when creating content, but we have to keep ourselves and organizations in mind by also standardizing the content. Having a personalized experience as a user can go a long way, as suggested by Valerie when she stated that 86% of customers said that a personalized experience made an impact on their buying decisions. However, having standardized and organized content as a technical communicator can also impact the efficiency and potential ease of use for rework of content for future uses. Valerie said, \u201cin order to create nimble reusable pieces of content that can be combined, on the fly, in different ways for different people and different devices, you must standardize everything about the content.\u201d If we can understand the Personalization Paradox correctly, then we all win in the end. Reflection Valerie\u2019s explanation of the Personalization Paradox, especially using the housing metaphor, was very useful when considering a way to personalize a user\u2019s experience, while still maintaining a level of standardization within an organization. As someone new to the field of technical communication, understanding the value of both personalization and standardization is valuable to keep in mind when moving forward in the workplace. It is valuable knowledge that appears to make a large impact for the entire organization and user - seems very important to me!","title":"LavaCon Presention"},{"location":"LavaCon/#lavacon-presention","text":"","title":"LavaCon Presention"},{"location":"LavaCon/#standardized-content-creates-personalized-experiences","text":"Contributed by Nicole McCoy This presentation was given by Valerie Swisher, CEO of Content Rules, Inc., and streamed by the LavaCon Content Strategy Conference in October, 2020.
